# vm-alloc-comparison

The aim of this project is to compare the effectiveness of different algorithms for virtual machine allocation. To achieve this purpose, the popular cloud simulator [CloudSim](http://www.cloudbus.org/cloudsim/) is extended with facilities to import data files of special format, to convert existing workload traces to the given format, and generate test data in the given format.

More information can be found in the paper entitled "Which is the best algorithm for virtual machine placement optimization?" by Zoltán Ádám Mann and Máté Szabó, which is currently under peer review.
